# yeast-clem-datasets

MoBIE project with data from the publication
[Seipin and Nem1 establish discrete ER subdomains to initiate yeast lipid droplet biogenesis](https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201910177).
The data was shared by Giulia Mizzon from the Electron Microscopy Core Facility at EMBL Heidelberg.

The project contains a single dataset `yeast` with the following image sources:
- EM-overview Single EM overview slices
- fluorescence-overview: GFP fluorescence channel registered to the em
- low magnitude tomograms: EM tomograms at 5 nm isotropic
- high magnitude tomograms: EM tomograms at 1.25 nm isotropic
